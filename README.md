## Deployment

To deploy this project run:


```bash
  git clone git@github.com:jhakonie/Rtv1.git rtv1
  cd rtv1
  make
```
SDL2 is included as sources in the root of the repository in a directory called libsdl2.
The Makefile will install it in the root of the repository. SDL2 can be deleted with 'make fclean'.

## Usage

```
To run the program:
    ./Rtv1 <path to configuration file>

For example:
    ./Rtv1 data/test.txt
```
The program reads the configuration file, but there are also hard coded scenes that can be switched to with keys 0-9.
The scene on the left is test.txt, the one on the right is behind key 4.
